Innovative, non-normative structural systems are investigated and discussed. Analysis and design will proceed using primarily computer-aided techniques. The course approach will involve in-class presentations, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies. WebCT will be used to expand the student’s access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning.
